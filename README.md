## Hi there 👋

👨‍🔬 I am Ligardi, a student at Universitas Padjadjaran in Indonesia. I am developing a web application that serves as a page directory for small businesses in the Jatinangor area of Indonesia, aiming to provide significant exposure to them because a lot of them have yet to have a personal website.

✨ My Abilities 
- HTML;
- CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS;
- Eleventy, Hugo, AlpineJS.
  
🎓 Currently Learning:
- Bulma CSS;
- React;
- Astro.

🎨 For prototyping & designing, I often use:
- Figma;
- Adobe XD;
- Adobe Illustrator;
- CorelDRAW 2020.

🤔 Despite all of this, I am interested to learn
- Svelte;
- Vue;
- Dart & Flutter.


Interested to working together? Slide through DM!
